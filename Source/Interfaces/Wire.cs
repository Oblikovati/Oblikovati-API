The bend and fold lines on the 3D flattened model of a sheet metal part are returned as a Wire object.

This is used to determine the side to offset the curves to.  A positive offset distance is in the direction of the cross product (wire_tangent x wire_plane_normal). A negative offset is in the opposite direction.</param>

    /// <param name="CornerClosureType">Input enum value that defines how to close the external corners of the offset. The valid values are listed below:
    /// kCircularCornerClosure - Circular arcs are attached tangentially to the offset edges so that gaps are replaced by rounded corners. In the picture below, the original curves are black, the offset curves are green and the circular rounded corner is red.
    /// kLinearCornerClosure - Linear extensions are attached tangentially to offset edges where there is a gap. The gap is closed where the extensions intersect, giving a sharp corner. In the picture below, the original curves are black, the offset curves are green and the linear extended corner is red.
    /// kExtendCornerClosure - Offset edges are extended smoothly where there is a gap, with the extension depending on the curve type. The gap is closed where the extensions intersect, giving a sharp corner. This method may fall back to using linear extensions or circular arcs if there is a problem.</param>
